This repo shows how to configure a [Gradle project](build.gradle) to download 
and execute the correct Terraform binary for the platform you're executing on.


## Pre-requisites
 
* AWS account ID/alias
* JDK 8+ available on the path of any machine that needs to run Gradle/TF tasks

# Setting up AWS

## Manual creation of AWS resources for Terraform to use

### Create an IAM user for TF to use

Never use the "root account" of an AWS account to do stuff.

* Go to IAM and create user.
    * enable `password`
        * store your password somewhere safe
    * don't enable `access key` - do it in IAM after logging in as the user
    * attach user directly to `AdministratorAccess`
* Immediately log out of your root account


### Configure authorization for Terraform

* sign in as the IAM user (will need your Account ID)
* In IAM console, find the new user and create an `access key`
    * save access key to `~/.config/tf-download/aws.credentials`  
```
[default]
aws_access_key_id=AKIAXXX
aws_secret_access_key=
```


## Create an S3 bucket for TF to store state in

Either create the bucket manually, or run the Gradle task

### Manual creation 

* in S3 console, create a new bucket to store the Terraform state file
* leave `ACLs disabled`, leave `block all public access`
    * TF will access the bucket via the access key from `gradle.properties`
    * privacy of this file is important because TF may store secrets in there
* enable `bucket versioning`
    * eventually, everyone mess up their state file, having history is helpful

### Gradle task

Note that you won't be able to run this task without changing the bucket name
because AWS S3 buckets must be globally unique.  
May want to change the region too, see 
[S3Util](buildSrc/src/main/groovy/tfdownload/S3Util.groovy).

* `./gradlew createS3StateBucket`
    * only need to run this once
